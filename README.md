## **Asterik Name Pattern (C++)**

**What is the code about?**

This C++ program displays the name “Muhammad Bin Umair” and the university details on the console screen using * characters.
The text is drawn by moving the cursor to specific positions on the screen with the help of the gotoxy() function.
Small delays are added using Sleep() to give a simple animation effect while printing the stars.
The program runs in a Windows console environment and waits for a key press before closing.

Open a C++ compiler on Windows (such as Dev-C++, Code::Blocks, or Visual Studio).
Create a new C++ project.
Add the source file containing main() and the header file Muhammad.h.
Make sure the compiler supports <windows.h> and <conio.h>.
Compile the program.
Run the executable file.
The output will appear in the console window. Press any key to exit.
